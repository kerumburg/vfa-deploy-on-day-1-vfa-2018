And I will eat them with a fox. And I will eat them in a house. And I will eat them with a mouse. And I will eat them here and there. Say! I will eat them ANYWHERE! I do so like green eggs and ham!

            <div class="description-holder">
              <p>I grew up in Memphis, TN, where I met my greatest friend, Nicole Mansour. We have been friends for over 16 years, and we went to middle school together. Having stayed in touch for so long, I actually told her about VFA. We both ended up becoming Fellows, choosing Birmingham as our VFA city, AND we were randomly placed in the same Challenge Group for Training Camp! What are the odds of that?! Anyways, my name is Sam, and I like green eggs and ham.</p>
